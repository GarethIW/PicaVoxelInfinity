A trimmed-down continuation of [PicaVoxel](https://github.com/GarethIW/PicaVoxel) with support for infinite streamed voxel volumes. Think Minecraft terrain.

No docs as yet, but there's a demo scene included with a full setup for terrain with a runtime editor (manipulator) and disk-based persistence.
